# python-project

## Install a package using `requirements.txt`
- Insert all dependencies that you need inside the `requirements.txt` file, as following:
  
  ```
  Flask==1.1.2
  ```
  
- Set up a virtual environment:
  
  ``` sh
  $ virtualenv venv
  ```
  
  This will create a new virtual environment named venv using the version of Python that you have installed on your system.
  
- Activate the virtual environment by sourcing the activation script:
  
  ``` sh
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  ```
  
  After executing this command, your prompt will change to indicate that you’re now operating from within the virtual environment.
 
- Install all dependencies:
  
  ``` sh
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Install a package using `setuptools` and `setup.py`

Create the following project structure:

  ```
  python-demo
  ├── README.md
  ├── LICENSE
  ├── setup.py
  ├── package_demo
  │   └── __init__.py
  └── tests
      ├── __init__.py
      └── test_python_demo.py
  ```
The contents of setup.py is just pure python:
  ``` python
  import os
  from setuptools import setup

  # Utility function to read the README file.
  # Used for the long_description.  It's nice, because now 1) we have a top level
  # README file and 2) it's easier to type in the README file than to put a raw
  # string in below ...
  def read(fname):
      return open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), fname)).read()

  setup(
      name = "an_example_pypi_project",
      version = "0.0.4",
      author = "Andrew Carter",
      author_email = "andrewjcarter@gmail.com",
      description = ("An demonstration of how to create, document, and publish "
                                     "to the cheese shop a5 pypi.org."),
      license = "BSD",
      keywords = "example documentation tutorial",
      url = "http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project",
      packages=['an_example_pypi_project', 'tests'],
      long_description=read('README'),
      classifiers=[
          "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
          "Topic :: Utilities",
          "License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License",
      ],
  )
  ```

Using setup.py
The basic usage of setup.py is:
``` sh
$ python setup.py <some_command> <options>
```

``` sh
$ python setup.py --help-commands
```

## Poetry

## Prerequisites

  * Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation), which lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. In alternatives, you can use [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer)

  * Install [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation), which is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. 

## Introduction
  
  `poetry` only needs one file to do all of that: the new, [standardized](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) `pyproject.toml`.

  In other words, poetry uses `pyproject.toml` to replace `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `MANIFEST.in` and the newly added `Pipfile`.

## Project setup
  
  First, let's create our new project, let's call it `poetry-demo`:

  `poetry new poetry-demo`

  This will create the `poetry-demo` directory with the following content:
  
  ```
  poetry-demo
  ├── pyproject.toml
  ├── README.rst
  ├── poetry_demo
  │   └── __init__.py
  └── tests
      ├── __init__.py
      └── test_poetry_demo.py
  ```

  The `pyproject.toml` file is what is the most important here. This will orchestrate your project and its dependencies. For now, it looks like this:

  ```
  [tool.poetry]
  name = "poetry-demo"
  version = "0.1.0"
  description = ""
  authors = ["Sébastien Eustace <sebastien@eustace.io>"]

  [tool.poetry.dependencies]
  python = "*"

  [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
  pytest = "^3.4"
  ```
  
### Initialising a pre-existing project
  
Instead of creating a new project, Poetry can be used to *'initialise'* a pre-populated directory. To interactively create a `pyproject.toml` file in directory pre-existing-project:

  ``` sh
  cd pre-existing-project
  poetry init
  ```

###Specifying dependencies

If you want to add dependencies to your project, you can specify them in the `tool.poetry.dependencies` section.

```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
pendulum = "^1.4"
```

As you can see, it takes a mapping of package names and version constraints.

Poetry uses this information to search for the right set of files in package "repositories" that you register in the tool.poetry.repositories section, or on PyPI by default.

Also, instead of modifying the pyproject.toml file by hand, you can use the add command.

``` sh
$ poetry add pendulum
```

It will automatically find a suitable version constraint and install the package and subdependencies.

## Using your virtual environment

By default, poetry creates a virtual environment in {cache-dir}/virtualenvs ({cache-dir}\virtualenvs on Windows). You can change the cache-dir value by editing the poetry config. Additionally, you can use the virtualenvs.in-project configuration variable to create virtual environment within your project directory.

There are several ways to run commands within this virtual environment.

### Using poetry `run`
To run your script simply use poetry run python your_script.py. Likewise if you have command line tools such as pytest or black you can run them using poetry run pytest.

### Activating the virtual environment
The easiest way to activate the virtual environment is to create a new shell with poetry shell. To deactivate the virtual environment and exit this new shell type exit. To deactivate the virtual environment without leaving the shell use deactivate.

Installing dependencies
To install the defined dependencies for your project, just run the install command.

poetry install
When you run this command, one of two things may happen:

Installing without poetry.lock
If you have never run the command before and there is also no poetry.lock file present, Poetry simply resolves all dependencies listed in your pyproject.toml file and downloads the latest version of their files.

When Poetry has finished installing, it writes all of the packages and the exact versions of them that it downloaded to the poetry.lock file, locking the project to those specific versions. You should commit the poetry.lock file to your project repo so that all people working on the project are locked to the same versions of dependencies (more below).

Installing with poetry.lock
This brings us to the second scenario. If there is already a poetry.lock file as well as a pyproject.toml file when you run poetry install, it means either you ran the install command before, or someone else on the project ran the install command and committed the poetry.lock file to the project (which is good).

Either way, running install when a poetry.lock file is present resolves and installs all dependencies that you listed in pyproject.toml, but Poetry uses the exact versions listed in poetry.lock to ensure that the package versions are consistent for everyone working on your project. As a result you will have all dependencies requested by your pyproject.toml file, but they may not all be at the very latest available versions (some of the dependencies listed in the poetry.lock file may have released newer versions since the file was created). This is by design, it ensures that your project does not break because of unexpected changes in dependencies.

Commit your poetry.lock file to version control
Committing this file to VC is important because it will cause anyone who sets up the project to use the exact same versions of the dependencies that you are using. Your CI server, production machines, other developers in your team, everything and everyone runs on the same dependencies, which mitigates the potential for bugs affecting only some parts of the deployments. Even if you develop alone, in six months when reinstalling the project you can feel confident the dependencies installed are still working even if your dependencies released many new versions since then. (See note below about using the update command.)

For libraries it is not necessary to commit the lock file.

Installing dependencies only
The current project is installed in editable mode by default.

If you want to install the dependencies only, run the install command with the --no-root flag:

poetry install --no-root
